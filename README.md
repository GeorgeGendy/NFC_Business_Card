NFC Business Card 
Two versions are included:

* One version uses standard layers (top, bottom, silk screen, tstop, etc).
* The other version mainly uses traces and does not need silk screen layer in case all what can be done is just milling the board. In this version, the LED is placed on the map, which is made of traces on the bottom layer. This version is not tested thought.


Smart phone app or tool can be used to program the NFC chip, assuming that the smart phone has NFC capabilities.
